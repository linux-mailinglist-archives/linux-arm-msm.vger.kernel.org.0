Oh I know, but since dma_fence is meant to be a wait_queue with hw
support, they really should work the same and have the same tuning.

I think the defaults are different because usually if you wake up a wait
queue, there's a 1:1 relationship between waker and waiter.

Otoh if you just wake a thread it's probably some kinda of service thread,
so N:1 relationship between waker and waiter. And in that case moving the
waiter is a really bad idea.

I think dma_fence is generally much closer to 1:1 (with the most common
one irq handler -> scheduler thread for that engine), so having the "same
cpu" wake behaviour really sounds like the right thing to do. And not
anything that is specifically an issue with how qualcom gpus work, and
hence should be msm specific.

If it turns out to be the wrong thing, well I guess we'll learn
something. And then maybe we have a different version of dma_fence_wait.

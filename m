Simpler than that - following on from my original comment above, 
tlb_flush_walk already knows it's invalidating at least one full level 
of table so there's nothing it even needs to check. Adding a size-based 
heuristic to arm_smmu_inv_range_* for leaf invalidations would be a 
separate concern (note that changing the non-leaf behaviour might allow 
cleaning up the "reg" indirection there too).

No, I'm really just wary that the performance implication is more 
complex than a simple unmap latency benefit, possibly even for QCOM. 
Consider the access latency, power and memory bandwidth hit from all the 
additional pagetable walks incurred by other ongoing traffic fighting 
against those 16 successive TLBIASIDs. Whether it's an overall win 
really depends on the specific workload and system conditions as much as 
the SMMU implementation. Thinking some more, I wonder if the Tegra folks 
might have an opinion to add here, given that their multiple-SMMU 
solution was seemingly about trying to get enough TLB and pagetable walk 
bandwidth in the first place?

Robin.

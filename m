At least, I was told by Jeffrey that MS admits this is something needs
to be fixed in the future.

Deduced by those working GPIO numbers in ACPI table and how Linux kernel
is working, I think the GPIO is numbered without any bank thing.  All
available pins are just numbered linearly, and every pin can be
configured in GPIO mode.

Unfortunately, all those documents are confidential to me as well.

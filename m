I had not seen that comment before, would have been excellent to include
in your "problem description".

In my view Dmitry had at least one proposal, that was rejected, where he
represented the qca6390 package as a thing in DeviceTree.

I'm not sure what you're trying to say here. There's no "PMU module" on
the board, it's a block within the QCA6390. But perhaps that's what
you're also saying?

So what you're proposing is that the PMU is the consumer of the external
supplies, and it in turn provides a set of internal power-rails which
should be consumed by the WiFi and BT modules.

That's sounds like a plausible way to get around the problem that we
don't want to represent a fake device in DeviceTree.

That still doesn't answer me why bluetooth suddenly now has an input
named "vddpcie0", can you please point me to the documentation of the
internal power routing in the QCA6390 that confirms this?

My bad. You're right, there is a block in the corner of the QCA6390
called "PMU".

Per Dmitry's argument that you linked above, bt-enable and wifi-enable
should be the only things that you need to synchronize.

Are you saying that the PMU contains a set of LDOs or similar that
alter the voltage from what's provided on the external pads?

I'm just making guesses about the design and how this fits into previous
discussions on the subject of PCI power sequencing, because you didn't
tell me what any of the things in this patch are.

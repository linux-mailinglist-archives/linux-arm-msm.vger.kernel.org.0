I hope that was in error, or no-one pointed it out to Rob.  As said
before there is no use to having this information in the applied patch,
even the kernel guidelines state so:

https://docs.kernel.org/process/submitting-patches.html

    Other comments relevant only to the moment or the maintainer, not
    suitable for the permanent changelog, should also go here. **A good
    example of such comments might be patch changelogs which describe
    what has changed between the v1 and v2 version of the patch.**

    **Please put this information after the --- line** which separates
    the changelog from the rest of the patch. The version information is
    not part of the changelog which gets committed to the git tree. It
    is additional information for the reviewers. If itâ€™s placed above
    the commit tags, it needs manual interaction to remove it. If it is
    below the separator line, it gets automatically stripped off when
    applying the patch:

Sounds good; though as said before I'm extremely short on time making it
hard to actively commit to this, especially as the catalog changes are
really hard to juggle between various "local" branches to test on the
many (Sony) devices we are working on.  As usual, a preview of v2 is
still available at:

https://github.com/SoMainline/linux/commits/marijn/dpu

And I will do my best to get the last comments worked out.

Forgot about your recovery cycle, on most of my boards I just load a new
kernel every boot, so there's no cost of recovering from a panic, it
might even save me some time if it crashes completely before userspace
starts consuming cycles.

My only concern is that this "sets" a quite fuzzy precedence. I don't
want us to just fix SA warnings all over the place, but I don't want it
to be inconvenient to work on the kernel...

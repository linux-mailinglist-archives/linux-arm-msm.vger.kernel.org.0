True, but those don't describe the hardware.

I guess some mobile SOC/snapdragon symbol would be more appropriate,
but given that qcom left the server business, I guess it hardly
matters, so default y if ARM64 && ARCH_QCOM is fine with me

I'd argue that this does not belong in /chosen in the first place,
i.e., it doesn't belong in the DT at all if the OS can access the
config table (and therefore the variable) directly.

Well if the ACPI table truely simply has a wrong number in it, like in
this case, then we clearly need a workaround.

And we have one in place, so I'm not sure what the question is?

I guess the question is of your generic GPIO renumber patch would not
be a better answer to that ?

IMHO no, we want to keep quirks out of the core as much as possible,
for example the code which Andy added a quirk to is build as a module
in the generic Fedora distro kernel, so for most users the code will
not be loaded into memory. Where as if we add it to the core it would
use up extra memory for everyone.

Also if, in the future, we were to ever add a generic GPIO renumber quirk
mechanism to the core, then your code would need more work. Because to be
truely generic it would need to remap one gpiochip-name:pin-number on
another gpiochip-name:pin-number pair. There might very well be a case
with multiple gpiochips with pin number 32 being referenced in the DSDT
and where we need to remap one of those 32-s to a different number
(or possibly even to a different chip + number).

Regards,

Hans

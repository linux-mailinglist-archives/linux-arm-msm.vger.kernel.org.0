We have also posted one RFC patch series which is based on this current 
patches by Boris and helping us to define our custom alloc and free 
pgtable call. For our side usecase we have a requirement to create 
pgtable from HLOS and then share it to different entity(VMID) and 
basically that also requires few smc calls and for that we need
custom alloc/free callbacks.

So custom allocator and free ops is helping for us also. Is there any 
plan to merge these patches from Boris.

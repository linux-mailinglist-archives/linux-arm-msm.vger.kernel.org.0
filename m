I think maybe USB interface is probably the most acceptable, since even 
at the USB snd level, they work based on usb_interface, not on the udev 
(USB device) itself.

I'll take a look at adding it into the components string.  At least in 
that case, we'd be able to dynamically modify to say if USB offload is 
supported or not based on the child entries/paths that are defined in 
the DT node.

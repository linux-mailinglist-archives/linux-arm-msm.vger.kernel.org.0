Hi Dmitry,

Sorry, I was busy with some other priority tasks.

Both firmware and software passive mitigations (CPU/GPU) are not 
permitted for Safe SoC. As mentioned in the commit, it is the 
responsibility of the safety subsystem to take corrective action for 
high temperatures. One of the safety requirements (not a functional 
requirement) for Safe SoC is to avoid scaling of CPUs and bus DCVS, as 
this could impact safety-critical workloads. Therefore, Safe SoC will 
operate at maximum frequency with the performance governor. Enabling a 
cooling device for the CPU would expose the cooling device sysfs 
interface, allowing userspace to request different cooling states via 
the cooling device cur_state sysfs, which could potentially lower the 
frequency and violate the safety requirement.

There is no interface issue, as it is not required and can be disabled 
for Safe SoC. This approach has already been used for commercializing 
the SA8775P, and we do not want to disrupt it now. Therefore, we believe 
it is better not to add cpu cooling cell property (CPU cooling device) 
in sa8775p base dtsi.

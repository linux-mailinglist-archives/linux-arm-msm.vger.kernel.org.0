Good Morning Friend,

My name is Mr. Gabriel Santos Rodrigo, I managed a Mining Company before I =
retired. I've been suffering from throat cancer for a long time, my doctors=
 reported that I may not live up to the next two or three months so I am lo=
oking for a reliable individual or an NGO (Non Governmental Organization) w=
hom I will entrust my final donation funds worth (=E2=82=AC 2,855,000 Euro)=
 for CHARITY PROJECT as it is my heart desire to accomplish this plan befor=
e I depart from this life.

My dying wish is to open a foundation for the less privileged and also to h=
elp families who have suffered greatly due to Covid-19 Pandemic. The pandem=
ic has affected so many businesses and livelihood, I want to be able to hel=
p such families with your assistance and  instead of leaving such an enormo=
us amount of money in the bank its better I use it and give hope to the hop=
eless.
I have no intentions of causing you any pains and the file attach to this e=
-mail is the full details, Please get back to me indicating your interest i=
n assistance.

Please let me know if you can carry out this humanitarian duty on my behalf=
. Once I receive your reply, I will send you my photos and give you more de=
tails about this project.
Take care and remain blessed my beloved friend.

Mr. Gabriel Santos Rodrigo,
Please send your reply to this E-mail: gavd544@gmail.com

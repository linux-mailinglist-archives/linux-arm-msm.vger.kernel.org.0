sm8550-qrd from this series.

> Changelog:
>
> Since v6:
> - kernel doc fixes
> - drop myself from the DT bindings maintainers list for ath12k
> - wait until the PCI bridge device is fully added before creating the
>   PCI pwrctl platform devices for its sub-nodes, otherwise we may see
>   sysfs and procfs attribute failures (due to duplication, we're
>   basically trying to probe the same device twice at the same time)
> - I kept the regulators for QCA6390's ath11k as required as they only
>   apply to this specific Qualcomm package
>
> Since v5:
> - unify the approach to modelling the WCN WLAN/BT chips by always exposing
>   the PMU node on the device tree and making the WLAN and BT nodes become
>   consumers of its power outputs; this includes a major rework of the DT
>   sources, bindings and driver code; there's no more a separate PCI
>   pwrctl driver for WCN7850, instead its power-up sequence was moved
>   into the pwrseq driver common for all WCN chips
> - don't set load_uA from new regulator consumers
> - fix reported kerneldoc issues
> - drop voltage ranges for PMU outputs from DT
> - many minor tweaks and reworks

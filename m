Ay, Quaramba! That's great news!

Do you happen to know if the same method would apply to other SoCs
from the same vendor? /me eyes the Lenovo c630 that is getting bored
with EL1 only...

Other SoCs have their maintenance interrupt wired to weird and
wonderful interrupts. Given QC's lack of appetite for standards, I'm
not totally surprised.

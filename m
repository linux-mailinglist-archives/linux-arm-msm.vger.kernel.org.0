Same here, but the frequency calculations are also unsigned long in higher
layers, so I don't see any point in making it u64(also 32-bit doesn't
support 32bit value to be divided by a 64bit value which adds unnecessary
complications here).

Yes this is exactly the argument I made myself and got convinced to keep
it unsigned long(KISS approach) unless we need it on v7.

Not sure myself.

On what grounds? Hardware incompatibility? I seriously doubt it, since
nobody glues pre-8.3 CPUs to anything more modern. Or, as I expect it,
a firmware implemented with little understanding of what is required?

What is even less desirable is to produce this sort of contraption.

Well, you get to own the problem you have created for yourself. You
build hardware/firmware that cannot run generic SW, and yet you want
generic SW to run seamlessly on it. Spot the issue?

Not only it predates it, but it also doesn't work in general. For a
start, it is DT specific. How are you going to make that work for
ACPI? I know you don't care, but I do.

You already have a way to have a sticky command-line, by building it
into the kernel. Yes, I understand that this isn't what you want, but:

(1) a user should be allowed to pass the kernel command-line *they*
    want, not what someone has decided for them

(2) the generic mechanism exists, doesn't rely on additional firmware
    specifications, and is used for a whole lot of other QC platforms
    suffering from the same issue of broken firmware.  What are you
    going to do for these?

(3) what if you, by miracle, happened to *fix* the firmware?

To sum it up, the kernel is not in the business of papering over these
issues. You have a tool to work around the problem you have created,
use it. Alternatively, you can always boot on a non-PAC CPU, and be
done with it.

Thanks,

	M.

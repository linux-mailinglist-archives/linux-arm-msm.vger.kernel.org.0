I had a check on the WQ_FREEZABLE flag, here is my understanding:

when the interrupt happened, it still need pm_stay_awake to make sure 
queue_work action can active the work instead of susepend the device.

1. If  WQ_FREEZABLE, pwq->max_active = 0; // maximum number of in-flight 
work items is set to 0.

[1]. 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc4/source/kernel/workqueue.c#L3748

2. If  WQ_FREEZABLE, will only check pwq->nr_active to see if there is 
still freeze_workqueues_busy.
[2]. 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc4/source/kernel/workqueue.c#L5270

3. When in queue_work, if max_active is 0, when do queue_work it will 
not actually active the work.
[3]. 
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1-rc4/source/kernel/workqueue.c#L1418

for the current issue, the work is already complete and forget to set 
pm_relax in some condition that make the system cannot be suspended.

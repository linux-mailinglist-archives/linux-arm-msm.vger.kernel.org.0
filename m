The big motivation for this patch series is mostly described in the patch
("drm/panel: Add a way for other devices to follow panel state"), but to
quickly summarize here: for touchscreens that are connected to a panel we
need the ability to power sequence the two device together. This is not a
new need, but so far we've managed to get by through a combination of
inefficiency, added costs, or perhaps just a little bit of brokenness.
It's time to do better. This patch series allows us to do better.

Assuming that people think this patch series looks OK, we'll have to
figure out the right way to land it. The panel patches and i2c-hid
patches will go through very different trees and so either we'll need
an Ack from one side or the other or someone to create a tag for the
other tree to pull in. This will _probably_ require the true drm-misc
maintainers to get involved, not a lowly committer. ;-)

Version 3 of this patch was a long time coming after v2. Maxime and I
had a very long discussion trying to figure out if there was a beter
way and in the end we didn't find one so he was OK with the series in
general [1]. After that got resolved, I tried to resolve Benjamin's
feedback but got stuck [2]. Presumably Benjamin is busy at the moment,
so I've done my best to try to resolve things. The end result is a v3
that's not that different from v2 but that has a tiny bit more code
split out.

Version 2 of this patch series didn't change too much. At a high level:
* I added all the forgotten "static" to functions.
* I've hopefully made the bindings better.
* I've integrated into fw_devlink.
* I cleaned up a few descriptions / comments.

This still needs someone to say that the idea looks OK or to suggest
an alternative that solves the problems. ;-)

Changes in v3:
- Add is_panel_follower() as a convenience for clients.
- Add "depends on DRM || !DRM" to Kconfig to avoid randconfig error.
- Split more of the panel follower code out of the core.

Changes in v2:
- Move the description to the generic touchscreen.yaml.
- Update the desc to make it clearer it's only for integrated devices.
- Add even more text to the commit message.
- A few comment cleanups.
- ("Add a devlink for panel followers") new for v2.
- i2c_hid_core_initial_power_up() is now static.
- i2c_hid_core_panel_prepared() and ..._unpreparing() are now static.
- ihid_core_panel_prepare_work() is now static.
- Improve documentation for smp_wmb().

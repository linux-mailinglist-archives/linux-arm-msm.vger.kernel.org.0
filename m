These tests all use an initrd, so I'd expect the kernel to spit out a
few more lines before waiting for the network to come up (log from a
good run as reference: https://pastebin.com/raw/rhPsLy1q ).

The USB network adapter is usually initialized a bit later in the boot
process indeed.

Thanks for the useful pointers!

Yes, I'll try to bisect this through KernelCI and report back.

Pasting new links to the logs mentioned above for future reference, as
they were removed from the KernelCI storage:

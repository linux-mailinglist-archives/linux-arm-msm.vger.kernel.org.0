Agreed that a TEST_ONLY commit without ALLOW_MODESET flag can be used to 
check
whether the modeset can be done seamless. But since there are no error 
code returns,
the client cannot distinguish the test_only commit failures from other 
invalid config failures.

Also, note that when the client sees two 1080p modes (vid/cmd) and it is 
interested only
to do *only* seamless switches, without any additional flag it cannot 
distinguish between
these two 1080p modes. The client has to invoke two test_only commits 
with these
modes to identify the seamless one. Is that a preferred approach?

Intel's "fastset" calculates the need for modeset internally based on 
the
configuration and chooses the best commit path. But the requirement here
is to expose the information up-front since the use case cannot afford
to fall back to the normal modeset when it has requested for a seamless 
one.

Yes. Pretty much those are reasons we need to switch to video mode. But 
instead
of making the decision internal to the driver based on the frequency of 
frame updates,
we have proprietary use cases where the client has to trigger the switch 
explicitly.
So we are trying to find ways to represent the same resolution in both 
video/cmd modes.

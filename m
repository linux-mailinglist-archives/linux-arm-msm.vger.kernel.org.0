Please remove the coresight_device and other dependencies. You may use
generic bits, CS_LOCK/UNLOCK etc. But including coresight-priv.h is
not something I would prefer. It brings in unnecessary dependencies
between two subsystems and I don't see any reason for using -priv.h.
It is named as it is, for a reason, coresight private definitions.

Why do they need to be coresight devices and appear on the coresight bus 
if they are not coresight devices ? As I understand they are simply
devices with some sysfs knobs.

Otherwise, happy with the proposal

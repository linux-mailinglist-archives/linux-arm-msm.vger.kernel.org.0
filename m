It's what I observe on WCN785x, on one side we have the usual VDD_AON/VDD_PMU/VDD_RFA/...
and on the other side the WCN internal PMU generates the VDDXX_PMU_XXX voltages that
are consumed by the WCN785x again.
The schematics is clearly split into different entities of the WCN785x:
- PMU
- VSS
- GND
- PWR
- CONFIG
- GPIO
- RFA
- PCIE

If you can log all the events you are processing, so that we can check 
when second event arrives for already processed TRE, is the transfer 
length same as originally processed TRE or it is different. In case it 
is different length, is the length matching to the TRE which was queue 
but not processed yet. You can print the mhi_queue_skb TRE content while 
queuing skb. How easy to reproduce this issue ? Is this showing up in 
high throughput use case or it is random? any specific step to reproduce 
this issue?

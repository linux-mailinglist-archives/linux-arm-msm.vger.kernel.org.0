It is generally very obvious to firmware authors to map hardware
definitions to specific bits in the state param. If a cluster component
has more than on/off state, more bits are assigned to the define the
idle states of the component.
Addition is also an option, but there are enough bits compared to the
hardware components that we have in each state, that it hasn't been a
problem.
